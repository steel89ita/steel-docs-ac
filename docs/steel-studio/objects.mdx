# Objects

The Objects tab in Steel Studio allows you to hide and show defined objects in the track. \
This is a quick way to show and hide them without the need to restart the game.

#### Here you can:

- Select which defined object to show or hide
- Save Objects to save the changes. When you restart the game and open Steel Studio you will restore the visibility as it was saved.
- Your objects are saved in the ```[track_folder]/extension/steelstudio/objects.json```, so you can share them with anyone.
