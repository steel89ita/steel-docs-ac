# Teleport

The Teleport tab in Steel Studio allows you to teleport your car in default and saved locations, or flip car orientation. 
This is a quick way to save your desired locations and use them again later.

#### Here you can:

- Add the current location by naming it in the input field and clicking **Add Location**
- **Remember**: click the <span class="text--success">**Save Locations**</span> button before closing ACT or Steel Studio.
- Click the Teleport to Starting Line / Hotlap Start or Pits to teleport to the default track locations.
- Click the <span class="text--info">**Flip Car Direction**</span> button to rotate the car by 180 degrees.
- Your locations are saved in the ```[track_folder]/extension/steelstudio/locations.json```, so you can share them with anyone.
