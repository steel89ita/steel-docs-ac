# Themes

The Themes tab in Steel Studio allows you to configure and save distinct theme palettes for each showroom. 
By selecting or creating a theme, you can instantly change the textures and colors in your showroom to match your desired aesthetic. 
This feature provides a seamless way to customize the visual appeal of your scenes, ensuring every photo shot is uniquely styled to perfection.

#### Here you can:

- Choose a saved palette or delete it.
- Insert a name in the _input box_ and **Save current theme** to save your chosen **background colors** and use again later.
- Your themes are saved in the ```[track_folder]/extension/steelstudio/theme_[name].json```, so you can share them with anyone.
