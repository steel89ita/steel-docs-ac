# Extra

The Extra tab in Steel Studio allows you change userful things to make your shots even better. \
This is a quick way to hide crew, drivers and disable audio.

#### Here you can:

- **Disable audio** of the game (<mark>Important:</mark> this setting is saved, remember to check it next time you open your game)
- **Hide Pit Crew**, so you don't have to use extra files or replace it.
- **Hide Drivers**, just a quick shortcut to hide drivers.
