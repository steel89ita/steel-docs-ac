# Getting Started

This documentation site help you configure and understand all about SteelRacing custom AC Mods.

Get started by navigating through the **left menu**.
Choose a section you need to know more about and start learning to customize the mod as you want.


### What you'll need

- [Assetto Corsa](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Version # or above (**Required**)
- [CSP](https://acstuff.ru) - Custom Shaders Patch (**Required**)
- [CM](https://acstuff.ru) - Content Manager

:::warning

Although **CM (Content Manager)** is not effectively required, is still _highly suggested_.
It lets you configure your tracks, cars and racing sessions in a comfortable UI.

:::

## CSP - Custom Shaders Patch

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

```jsx title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
function HelloCodeTitle(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

:::danger

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
